+Code the following app
+```
+Idea: A calculator for Liquidity Providers (LPs) in DeFi to track or simulate Impermanent Loss.
+User Goal: Decide if providing liquidity is profitable compared to just holding the tokens.
+Core Features (MVP):
+
+* Inputs: Token A & B prices at entry, Current prices, Pool Weight (50/50).
+* Output: Impermanent Loss %, Value if Held, Value in Pool.
+* "Break-even" calculator: How much trading fee APY is needed to cover the IL.
+
+Development Plan:
+
+1. Implement the standard xy=k AMM formulas for IL calculation.
+2. Create a reactive UI where users can slide price bars to simulate "What if price goes up 10%?".
+3. Fetch live prices for auto-filling current values.
+4. Support different pool weights (e.g., Balancer 80/20 pools).
+5. Mobile-friendly design for quick checks on the go.
